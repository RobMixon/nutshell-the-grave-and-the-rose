# MyNutshell: The Revolution in Informational Dashboards

## Description: 
Note: This dashboard is not for the fainthearted. There's a difference between us. You think the people of this country exist to provide you with position. I think your position exists to provide those people with freedom. And I go to make sure that they have it. This dashboard is to provide you and your associates the ability to disseminate information between one another or cute dog pics. All in the name of FREEEEDDDDOOOMMMM! 

## Setup: Follow these steps exactly

1. Clone this repository
1. `cd` into the directory it creates
1. Make a `database.json` file in the `api` directory
1. Serve the JSON file database.json utilizing the json-server -p 8088 -w database.json in terminal. Note: you must have npm installed.
1. Now serve main.js in scripts directory. 
1. Open google chrome web browser and go to the port that you have served the site to. You should be seeing the webpage at this point in chrome. 
1. Register and begin your journey in the world of free flowing information. 


> **Note:** Your `database.json` file is already in the `.gitignore` file for this project, so it will never be added to the repo or pushed to Github.

## JSON folder
Your JSON folder will be automatically populated with the information you and your allies add into the dashboard. Do not worry if this is blank at start up but, if it stays blank after registration, please check your ports for proper flow path of information. 


## Support

Support and assistance can be found from your fellow allies at NSS-day-cohort-41/nutshell-the-grave-and-the-rose. Don't worry, we ARE NOT the British. 

## Release

Expected release should be July 2, 2020 but we are coders so be prepared for delays.
